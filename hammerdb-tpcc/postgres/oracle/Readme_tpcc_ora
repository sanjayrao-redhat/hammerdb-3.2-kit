Install Oracle from the kits. 

Once the install is complete, install Hammerdb

mount perf1:/shak /shak

cd /shak/HammerDB/

### Check and install the latest Hammerdb version. There maybe a newer version than the one in the command below
./HammerDB-3.2-Linux-x86-64-Install


cd /usr/local/HammerDB-3.0/
chmod 777 /usr/local/HammerDB-3.0/

mkdir /perf1/oracle
chown oracle:dba /perf1/oracle


The oracle run is done as "oracle user", so the permissions for the run directory is set to allow all run files
to be copied by the oracle user

su - oracle

cp /shak/HammerDB/tpcc/oracle/* .

Edit the setoraenv.sh file and make sure that the Oracle home is set properly. Execute it to set the environment

. ./setoraenv.sh

build the database
./createdb_ora.sh


./createdb_ora.sh

Edit file buildora.tcl and set the warehouse count and execute buildora.sh to build the schema

./buildora.sh
